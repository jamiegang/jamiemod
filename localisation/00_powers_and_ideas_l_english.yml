 mfa_wine_desc:0 "The wines produced in the hills around Montferrat are renowned throughout Europe for their quality. Likewise, our lands also produce truffles. Our wines and fine white truffles fetch a handsome price in the courts of many fellow rulers; we should encourage further cultivation."

 noble_knights_desc:0 "Supporting cavalry requires an economic system that produces a large number of surplus horses. If we were to guarantee the privileges of our noble class not only would they be much happier they would do much of the work to produce the needed horses. Our court fool described it as service guarantees serfs."
 pserfdom:0 "Serfdom"
 pserfdom_desc:0 "A foot soldier in the army is not quite the career that anyone wanted, what with the poor food, low pay, and virtually non existent medical services. If we were to tie our peasants to the land we would know exactly where to look for recruits."
 pinternational_nobility:0 "International Nobility"
 pinternational_nobility_desc:0 "International relations are a tricky business. Some say that the merchant class who are used to dealing with foreigners are best for this. Those who say this ignore the kindred ties that our noble families have established through the years, these ties should be taken advantage of to help our cause diplomatically."
 pnoble_resilience:0 "Noble Connections"
 pnoble_resilience_desc:0 "The various mercenary groups of this continent are often headed by lesser nobles. By befriending the nobility we can make use of their network of contacts to seek out more and larger groups of mercenary soldiers."
